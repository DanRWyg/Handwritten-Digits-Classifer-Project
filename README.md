# Georgia Tech CS 4641 Machine Learning Project: Handwritten Digits Classifier
This repository contains the python code that implements my final project alongside a pdf report describing the details of the project and its results.

### Brief Description:
For my project, I chose to test the performance of several classifiers against identifying handwritten digits.
The classifiers I used were Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.
More details about the datasets used, how the testing was conducted, and the results of the project can be found in the [report](/report.pdf).
